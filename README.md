# Traffic Sign Detector (TSD)
TSD is my Artificial Intelligence course final project which has been implemented using Python, CUDA, and YOLOv5 library. The dataset is the results of the efforts of my friends and me which includes 1,325 pictures collected and annotated from traffic signs. The classes that this model is capable of detecting are as follows:

- Do Not Enter
- Keep Right
- Max Speed 40
- Max Speed 60
- No Horn
- No Left Turn
- Keep Straight
- No Right Turn
- No U-Turn
- Parking
- Bicycle
- Stopping and Parking are prohibited

In the following pictures, you can see the model detection examples:
